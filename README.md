# PSU Triangle Fraternity Network-Attached Storage (NAS)

## Background

During the 2019-2020 academic year, we applied for and received a
[Chuck Bowman Chapter Endowment][1] disbursement for $940, which was
intended for [a "Study Materials Consolidation" program][2]. Primarily,
we identified a printer and Synology NAS for purchase.

The stated purpose of the NAS was to "enable ready access to past
coursework in an increasingly digital environment," which justifies its
designation within two accepted Endowment categories: "chapter computer
equipment & software" and "books, texts and other resource materials to
be maintained in the chapter library/study room."
